# Total P&L CLI helpers

This project includes a pair of Node scripts that let you compute and validate the Total P&L series for a Questrade account without spinning up the full web stack. They live under `server/src/scripts/` and are exposed through npm scripts so you can run them from the `server/` directory.

## Prerequisites

1. Follow the main [README](../../README.md) to install dependencies and seed `server/token-store.json` with at least one Questrade refresh token.
2. Copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env` if you have not already so the proxy can load required environment variables.
3. Make sure you are using Node.js 20.19 or newer.

Both scripts automatically load environment variables from `.env` via `dotenv` and reuse the same login/account helpers that back the Express proxy.

## `validate-total-pnl`

Use this command when you want to confirm that the running Total P&L series reconciles with the summary net deposits and P&L values returned by the Questrade API. It compares the final point in the computed series with the combined CAD summary and fails if the difference exceeds your chosen threshold (default `0.01`).

```bash
cd server
npm run validate-total-pnl -- --account <accountNumber|id> [--login <loginId>] [--threshold <cad>] [--no-cagr-start]
```

Arguments:

- `--account` / positional `id` (required): Account number, UUID, or friendly name as returned by Questrade.
- `--login` (optional): Explicit login id when multiple tokens are configured. If omitted the first login in `token-store.json` is used.
- `--threshold` (optional): Absolute CAD difference allowed between the summary Total P&L and the final series point before the script exits with code `1`.
- `--no-cagr-start` (optional flag): Skip any account-specific `cagrStartDate` adjustments when computing the series.

Sample output:

```
Account: 12345678 - RESP Family
Period : 2019-01-01 → 2025-02-14
Points : 438
Summary total P&L (CAD): 12,345.67
Series final P&L  (CAD): 12,345.61
Difference          (CAD): 0.06
Threshold           (CAD): 0.25
Within threshold: yes

Validation succeeded.
```

If the diff exceeds the threshold the script prints the last five data points to help you diagnose where the series diverged and exits with status code `1` so it can be wired into CI.

## `print-total-pnl-series`

Use this helper to inspect the computed Total P&L series. It prints a high-level summary and a preview table so you can spot gaps in funding data or missing price history before running the validation step.

```bash
cd server
npm run print-total-pnl -- --account <accountNumber|id> [--no-cagr-start] [--preview count]
```

Arguments:

- `--account` / positional `id` (required): Account identifier (same matching rules as the validator).
- `--no-cagr-start` (optional flag): Skip applying any account-level CAGR start date override.
- `--preview` (optional): Number of trailing rows to print in the preview table (defaults to `10`).

The summary includes the computed net deposits, total equity, and total P&L. The script also reports any missing price symbols or issues returned by the underlying calculator and highlights whether the last point matches the summary within 5 cents.

When you pass `--no-cagr-start`, the preview table displays delta values (`Δ`) that represent changes since the first date in the series, and the summary prints both the change and the all-time totals so you can see how the account has performed over the window you requested. The CLI now also echoes the baseline net deposits, equity, and total P&L for that first date so it is easy to reconcile the deltas with the actual funding activity.

## Troubleshooting tips

- Ensure the target account has recent activity before limiting the date window—Questrade may omit historical balances for long-dormant accounts.
- If you see `Unable to locate account` errors, re-run `npm run seed-token` with `--id` labels that match what you pass to `--login` and confirm the account number in Questrade's portal.
- The helpers depend on live API calls. If the Questrade API is down or rate limiting requests, rerun the scripts later.
- To debug further, open `server/src/scripts/validate-total-pnl.js` or `print-total-pnl-series.js` and adjust logging as needed.
